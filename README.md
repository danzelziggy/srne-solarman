You need to find out what IP address your router assigned to the Orange Pi.

**Method 1: Check Your Router (Easiest)**
1. Open your router's admin page (usually http://192.168.1.1 or http://192.168.0.1)
2. Log in with your router credentials
3. Look for "Connected Devices" or "DHCP Clients" or "Device List"
4. Find a device named "orangepione" or "orangepizero3" or similar
5. Note the IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.50)

**Method 2: Use Windows CMD (Alternative)**
1. Open Command Prompt on your Windows PC
2. Type: `arp -a`
3. Look for an entry with manufacturer "Xunlong" (Orange Pi's maker)
4. Note the IP address

**Method 3: Use IP Scanner App**
1. Download "Advanced IP Scanner" (free): https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/
2. Click "Scan"
3. Find "orangepi" in the list
4. Note the IP address

---

### Step 7: Connect via SSH (Remote Terminal)

Now we'll access the Orange Pi from your Windows PC using SSH (a way to control it remotely).

**Windows 10/11 Built-in SSH:**

1. **Open PowerShell or Command Prompt**
   - Press `Windows + R`
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter

2. **Connect to Orange Pi**
   ```
   ssh root@192.168.1.50
   ```
   *Replace 192.168.1.50 with YOUR Orange Pi's IP address*

3. **First Time Connection:**
   - You'll see a message about authenticity - type `yes` and press Enter

4. **Login Credentials:**
   - Username: `root`
   - Password: `1234` (default for Armbian)
   - **You won't see characters as you type the password** - this is normal!

5. **Change Password (Required):**
   - Armbian will force you to change the password on first login
   - Enter new password (at least 8 characters)
   - Type it again to confirm
   - Write this password down somewhere safe!

6. **Create a Regular User (Optional):**
   - Armbian will ask if you want to create a normal user
   - You can skip this by pressing Ctrl+C
   - We'll use root for this project (it's okay for home use)

✅ **You're now connected to your Orange Pi!**

---

### Step 8: Configure WiFi (Orange Pi Zero 3 Only)

If you have Orange Pi Zero 3 and want to use WiFi instead of Ethernet:

1. **While connected via SSH, run:**
   ```bash
   nmtui
   ```

2. **Configure WiFi:**
   - Use arrow keys to navigate
   - Select "Activate a connection"
   - Press Enter
   - Select your WiFi network
   - Enter password
   - Press Tab to select "OK", press Enter

3. **Verify WiFi Connection:**
   ```bash
   ip addr show wlan0
   ```
   You should see an IP address assigned

4. **Note the NEW WiFi IP address** (it might be different from Ethernet!)

5. **Now you can disconnect Ethernet cable**

6. **Reconnect via SSH** using the new WiFi IP:
   ```
   ssh root@[new-wifi-ip]
   ```

---

### Step 9: Update Your Orange Pi

Before installing anything, let's update the system:

```bash
# Update package lists
apt update

# Upgrade installed packages (this may take 10-15 minutes)
apt upgrade -y

# Install essential tools
apt install -y \
    software-properties-common \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    wget \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release \
    net-tools \
    iputils-ping \
    git \
    htop \
    nano
```

Wait for everything to complete (10-20 minutes depending on internet speed).

**Optional: Reboot**
```bash
reboot
```

Wait 2 minutes, then reconnect via SSH.

---

### Step 10: Set Static IP (Recommended)

To prevent your Orange Pi's IP address from changing:

**Method 1: Router DHCP Reservation (Recommended)**
1. Go to your router's admin page
2. Find "DHCP Reservation" or "Static IP Assignment"
3. Reserve the current IP for your Orange Pi's MAC address
4. This ensures the same IP every time

**Method 2: Configure on Orange Pi**
1. Edit network configuration:
   ```bash
   nano /etc/netplan/10-dhcp.yaml
   ```

2. Change content to (adjust for your network):
   ```yaml
   network:
     version: 2
     renderer: networkd
     ethernets:
       eth0:
         dhcp4: no
         addresses:
           - 192.168.1.50/24
         gateway4: 192.168.1.1
         nameservers:
           addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
   ```

3. Save and exit: `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then Enter

4. Apply changes:
   ```bash
   netplan apply
   ```

### 🆘 Orange Pi Troubleshooting

**Problem: Can't find Orange Pi's IP address**
- Make sure you waited 2-3 minutes after powering on
- Check that the Ethernet cable is properly connected (or WiFi is configured)
- Try connecting a monitor via HDMI to see the IP on screen
- Look for blinking LEDs - solid/blinking = good, off = problem

**Problem: SSH connection refused**
- Wait another minute - SSH service may still be starting
- Verify you're using the correct IP address
- Make sure you're on the same network
- Try pinging first: `ping 192.168.1.50`

**Problem: Password `1234` doesn't work**
- Someone may have already set up this Orange Pi
- Try resetting by reflashing the MicroSD card (Step 3)

**Problem: Orange Pi won't boot (no LEDs)**
- Check power adapter is working (try different USB cable/adapter)
- Verify MicroSD card is inserted correctly
- Re-flash the MicroSD card - it may have failed
- Try a different MicroSD card

**Problem: Lost SSH connection**
- Orange Pi might have gotten a new IP after reboot
- Check router for current IP address
- Set up static IP to prevent this

### Step 4: Customize for Your System

**Important: You MUST change the battery capacity!**

In the configuration above, find this line:
```yaml
battery:
  energy: 28512  # <-- CHANGE THIS!
```

**Calculate your battery capacity:**
```
Battery Voltage × Capacity in Ah = Wh

Example:
48V × 594Ah = 28,512 Wh
```

**Common battery sizes:**
- 48V × 100Ah = 4,800 Wh
- 48V × 200Ah = 9,600 Wh
- 48V × 300Ah = 14,400 Wh
- 48V × 400Ah = 19,200 Wh
- 48V × 594Ah = 28,512 Wh (example in config)

Change the `energy:` value to match your system!

---

### Step 5: Save and View

1. Click **"SAVE"** button
2. Click **"DONE"** in the top right
3. You should now see your beautiful power flow dashboard!

**What you'll see:**
- ☀️ Solar panels with current production
- 🔋 Battery with charge level and power flow
- 🏠 Home consumption
- ⚡ Grid import/export status
- 📊 Daily totals for each component

---

### Troubleshooting Dashboard

**Problem: Card shows error "Custom element doesn't exist"**

Solution:
1. Make sure you added the resource in Settings → Dashboards → Resources
2. Hard refresh your browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. Check browser console for errors (Press F12)
4. Try incrementing the version: `/local/sunsynk-power-flow-card/sunsynk-power-flow-card.js?ver=2`

**Problem: Card shows but no data (all zeros or N/A)**

Solution:
1. Verify Solarman integration is working (check Settings → Devices & Services)
2. Check that entity IDs match your system
3. Go to Settings → Devices & Entities → search for "srne"
4. Verify sensors have data (not "Unavailable")

**Problem: Card layout looks broken or weird**

Solution:
1. Make sure you copied the ENTIRE configuration
2. Check YAML indentation (spaces, not tabs)
3. Paste config into a YAML validator online
4. Clear browser cache completely

**Problem: Permission errors (Linux)**

Solution:
```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /root/solarman/homeassistant_config/www
docker restart homeassistant
```

### Optional: Customize the Card

You can customize colors, show/hide elements, and more. See the full documentation:
- [Sunsynk Power Flow Card Docs](https://github.com/slipx06/sunsynk-power-flow-card#readme)

Common customizations:
- Change colors: `inverter.colour: blue`
- Hide elements: `show_solar: false`
- Add more MPPTs: `solar.mppts: 3`
